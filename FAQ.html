            <h5>What's Multi Go?</h5>
            <p>
                MultiGo will be something like Minecraft and BG, Paided and non paided sides both!
            </p>
            <h5>What do you mean by paid and non paided?</h5>
            <p>
                It means that Multi Go will be free to play but by using the website you can make server! (Smp in Multi Go) and its gonna be in paid side, but the free side is like bg and minecraft mix.. It's a unlimited experience! Never experienced before!!!

        <h5>Why is there a paid side of Multi Go??Why can't it be free??</h5>
        <p>
            To pay the hosts/Servers.. we need some money and if we don't have it.. it will make the game stop the services in sometime... and it's better to have a no Pay2win option it just let's you make a private server of a game simular to skyblock and bedwars. Recommend for people who want to play alone with their friends it's a monthly payment although...
        </p>
        <h5>
            Will Multi Go have Separate Region ( Region Update )?</h5>
        <p>
            No, We made Regional servers Because Many people don't know english well, so we did these Servers, Multi Go won't have Region update as we don't like to separate players from players.
        </p>
        <h5>Is there a donation perks?</h5>
        <p>
            Yes soon we will put it here, donaters will have many perks...

        </p>
        <h5>What are the perks for the server boosters?? </h5>
        <p>They will have MultiCash, 1x boost = 250 MultiCash, 2Ã— boost = 600 MultiCash if you transfer you boost before 1 month we have rights not to not give you the MultiCash!

        </p>
        <h5>Do we have invite rewards!?!?</h5>
        <p>
            Yes we do!
            5 invites = 25 MultiCash 
           10 invites = 85 MultiCash 
           20 invites = 210 MultiCash
        </p>
        <h5>Will the game come in Playstore? </h5>
        <p>
        
there is *2 answer for this Question first answer is Yes, we can put game in playstore , the other answer is No, we still don't know if it will come as we need Money to put game in playstore, also we need Money in the game so maybe we will release the game on Multi GO website and pay just servers then when we have enough money we will put game in Play Store.
        </p>
        <h5>Do we have messages rewards?</h5>
        <p>
            Yes, we do

 2000 messages = 55 Multi Coin
300k+ messages = 10 Super MultiCoin 
500k+ messages = 120 Super Multi Coin
Next onwards 1000k msg = 300 Super Multi Coin
